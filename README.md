Bootout 0.0.3
=============

A collection of Knockout bindings for Bootstrap Icons, Bootstrap Progress Bars, and Bootstrap's 13 jQuery plugins.

NOTE 1: These bindings should be used as a replacement for bootstrap's data- javascript apis. The bindings and the data- apis will collide in behavior and should not be used on the same element.

NOTE 2: The github contains a 'default.html' file which contains in-progress usage examples. Documentation will be forthcoming when initial version of all bindings are complete.

NOTE 3: This is not a pure bootstrap JS wrapper. Some of bootstrap's JS methods cause some difficulty in designing a binding handler, and so in those cases bootstrap's functionality was mimicked in a way that allows it to be stateful.
